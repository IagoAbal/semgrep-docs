# General

#### How is Semgrep different from CodeQL?
Both Semgrep and CodeQL use static analysis to find bugs. Semgrep operates directly on source code, whereas CodeQL requires a buildable environment. Both have an open source set of rules. CodeQL is not open source, Semgrep is LGPL. Semgrep focuses on speed and ease of use. Because it doesn’t require a buildable environment, it doesn’t have some of the features that CodeQL has (like types and interprocedural dataflow analysis). Semgrep supports auto-fixes. Semgrep rules look like the source code you’re writing, CodeQL has a separate domain-specific-language for writing queries.

#### How is Semgrep different than SonarQube?
Both Semgrep and SonarQube use static analysis to find bugs. While Semgrep engine is generic, the Semgrep rules are targeted to OWASP Top 10 and other security-centric issues. Both products are open-source. Extending Semgrep with custom rules is simple, since Semgrep rules look like the source code you’re writing. Writing custom rules with SonarQube is [restricted to a handful of languages](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/extend/adding-coding-rules/) and requires familiarity with Java and abstract syntax trees (ASTs).

#### How is Semgrep different than linters?
Linters use static analysis but have a narrower scope for analysis (most rules typically operate on a single line).

Semgrep incorporates rulesets inspired by the rules of many popular linters and checkers, including ESLint, RuboCop, Bandit, and FindSecBugs. But Semgrep also allows you to enable multiple rulesets at the same time without adding linter-specific artifacts or installation to your code repository.

Lastly, while many linters are extensible, with Semgrep you don’t need to learn specific abstract syntax tree (AST) based patterns for writing custom rules. You can read more about the spectrum from linters to complex analysis tools in Instagram's wonderful article [Static Analysis at Scale: An Instagram Story](https://instagram-engineering.com/static-analysis-at-scale-an-instagram-story-8f498ab71a0c).

#### What is your support policy?
Help is available for all users, free or otherwise, through the [r2c Community Slack](https://r2c.dev/slack). Semgrep Team tier customers receive 8\*5 email/phone/Slack support with committed SLAs. See [Support](support.md) for more details.

# Billing / Pricing

#### What features differ between the Semgrep Community (free) and Team (paid) versions?
See the Semgrep feature and pricing comparison at [r2c.dev/pricing](https://r2c.dev/pricing)

#### Who is a user and how do you count them?
For the Semgrep Team edition, a user is any project contributor whose pull request or code was scanned in the billing cycle. For example, if a project has 4 unique contributors who pushed code during the period, and Semgrep runs on all their pull requests, there are 4 users. If these unique contributors push to many projects, they will only be counted once; please feel free to scan often and widely. Semgrep does not charge on a line-of-code or per-project basis. 

# Privacy and Security

#### Where do you store data?
r2c uses Amazon Web Services (US region) for storing customer data.

#### How is data secured, including data-at-rest and data-in-transit?
All customer data is located in AWS (US region). Amazon RDS encrypted DB instances use industry standard AES-256 encryption and TLS 1.2 or higher is used for all data-in-transit.

#### Is private source code shared with r2c?
No. Semgrep CI runs fully in your CI pipeline and your source-code never leaves your environment. Only meta-data related to Semgrep runs (see below) are sent to Semgrep's service.

#### What data do you store?
Semgrep CI collects usage data to provide useful results and to help improve the product. Two types of data are sent to r2c servers: scan data and findings data. Scan data includes project id, CI environment and scan meta-data. Findings data are used to provide human readable content for notifications and integrations, as well tracking results as new, fixed, or duplicate. For more information and detailed description for each data field, refer to Semgrep CI [PRIVACY.md](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-action/blob/develop/PRIVACY.md). Note that [Semgrep CLI](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep) does not collect or send any scan or findings data.

# Configuration

#### How do I configure Semgrep for different projects?
Semgrep Community and Team editions provide centralized policy management. See [Managing CI policy](managing-policy.md) for more details.

#### What is a policy?
A policy is a simple collection of rules and a definition of what to do with rule results: fail the Semgrep CI run and/or send non-blocking notifications to third-party services like Slack. Please see [Managing CI policy](managing-policy.md) for more details.

# Monitoring

#### Do you have a visualization UI?
Dashboarding is available for Semgrep Team users. Semgrep also supports posting results via web hooks to any JSON endpoint, so you can easily integrate it with your favorite visualization tool.
